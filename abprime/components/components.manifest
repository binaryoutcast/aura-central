# Normally it doesn't quite matter WHEN the components load as long as they load..
# However, ABPrime wants everything to be initallized well before the main window
# spawns so we put the component registration in the main chrome.manifest elsewhere.
# The build system demands to have a manifest file along side any components though,
# so here it is to keep it from bitching.
